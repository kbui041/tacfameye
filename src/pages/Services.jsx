        <h2>Adult Eye Care</h2>
        <p>
          The American Optometric Association recommends that most people have their eyes examined every one to two years depending on their age and health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Routine eye exams are an important way of maintaining your best vision and eye health. Our exams include tests for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eye alignment</li>
          <li>Pupil testing and reflexes</li>
          <li>Visual fields</li>
          <li>Vision testing (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, presbyopia)</li>
          <li>
            Eye health evaluation (external and internal), including screening for:
            <ul>
              <li>Cataracts</li>
              <li>Glaucoma</li>
              <li>Macular degeneration</li>

        <h2>Pediatric Eye Care</h2>
        <p>
          Experts say 25% of school-aged children suffer from some vision problem. Early detection is important to prevent permanent vision loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          School screenings often miss issues like muscle coordination, diseases, and peripheral vision problems. Most visual defects discovered before age five can be treated.
        </p>
        <p>Signs your child may be experiencing vision issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Squinting</li>
          <li>Headaches</li>
          <li>Eyes pointing in different directions</li>
          <li>Blurred or double vision</li>
          <li>Tilted head when looking at objects</li>
          <li>Holding books too close or too far</li>
          <li>Short attention span while reading</li>
          <li>Frequent blinking or eye rubbing</li>
          <li>Red or swollen eyes</li>
